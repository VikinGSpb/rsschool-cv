        <h2>About me:</h2><br>
        <p>I'm <strong>29</strong> years old. I've been interested in programming since high school. But after many attempts at University, I left programming for a long time. 
          I made money playing poker for some time before going back to my dream of becoming a programmer. I started with C++. But after a few months of training, I became interested in front-end development. And here I am.
          I also have many non-programming hobbies such as <em>drumming, bodybuilding, history, philosophy, board games, writing poetry and yoga.</em></p>
