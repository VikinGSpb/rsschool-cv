# Hello!

My name is **Denis Arkhipov** and I'm going to be a web-developer.

## About me:
I'm *29* years old. I've been interested in programming since high school. But after many attempts at University, I left programming for a long time. 
I made money playing poker for some time before going back to my dream of becoming a programmer. I started with C++. But after a few months of training, I became interested in front-end development. And here I am.
I also have many non-programming hobbies such as *drumming, bodybuilding, history, philosophy, board games, writing poetry and yoga.*
